# Nodejs training

This is a project for training nodejs. It uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to quickly build and run the project.
For database, it uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) as ORM, and to expose an API, it uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/).
